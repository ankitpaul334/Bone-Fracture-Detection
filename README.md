#  Bone Fracture Detection System

An AI-powered medical imaging project that uses deep learning models (ResNet50) to automatically detect bone fractures from X-ray and MRI scans. This system assists radiologists by improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing diagnosis time, and increasing accessibility to quality healthcare diagnostics.

##  Project Overview

This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for:
- Bone Type Classification (Hand, Elbow, Shoulder)
- Fracture Detection based on classified bone type
- Severity Estimation to assist in clinical decision-making

The system is trained on the MURA dataset, one of the largest public musculoskeletal radiograph datasets.

##  Features

- Image preprocessing: noise reduction, augmentation, and resizing
- ResNet50-based bone classification and fracture detection
- Heatmap-based output visualization
- Functional test case validation
- Privacy-preserving data handling

##  Folder Structure

- `/data` â€“ Contains processed/raw images
- `/models` â€“ Trained deep learning models
- `/notebooks` â€“ Model training/evaluation notebooks
- `/src` â€“ Core code for preprocessing, model training, and inference
- `/app` â€“ Flask-based UI for predictions
- `/docs` â€“ Project documentation and reports
- `/tests` â€“ Functional test cases and results

##  Models Used

- ResNet50 (Main architecture)
- Optional: DenseNet & VGG16 (for comparison)
